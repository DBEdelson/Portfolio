          <p class="bio"> My name is David B. Edelson.  I am a military veteran with 20 years of faithful service to the United States Coast Guard. 
            During this time, I've worn many hats and held leadership positions that require a great deal of independent decision making while working as a 
            team to achieve goals and meet deadlines.  As a Chief Boatswains Mate, I've had the opportunity to travel around the world and experience the 
            cultural richness of places and various populations.  

            I have been able to serve in a capacity that extended beyond the four walls of my office, 
            and that is what I hope to gain from the Boot Camp Coding program at the University of Texas.   
            I am eager to utilize the learned programs and transfer this knowledge into a challenging position 
            with a company I can grow with and one that will provide a positive impact to the community, as well as the stakeholders.  
            I am excited for the opportunities that lay ahead and look forward to starting this career outside of the military. </p>
